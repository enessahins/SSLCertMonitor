By using cron, you can schedule SSLCertMonitor to check your SSL/TLS certificates regularly and ensure timely notifications for any issues or expirations.

First, edit the crontab file by running:
> crontab -e

Then, add a line to the crontab file like this:
0 0 * * * /path/to/your/sslcertmonitor.sh
